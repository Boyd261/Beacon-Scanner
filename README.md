# Beacon-Scanner

Scans and shows details of every iBeacon, Eddystone (TLM, UID, URL frames) and AltBeacon in your area.

This app displays the following information of a beacon:
* UUID, Minor and Major values for iBeacons/Altbeacons. TLM, URL and UID frames for Eddystone.
* Distance to beacon
* TX and RSSI values
* Bluetooth information like MAC address and more

This application is an open source project. We're students in our 2nd year so any feedback is much appreciated! If you have a great idea just submit a pull request!

For version 1.0 we kept it simple and clean. A new version is already in the works, some of the features we're working on are:
* Better designed beacon detail view
* Customisable scan settings
* Saving and sending log files
* Transmitting as a beacon
